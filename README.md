## Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) exhibit varying strengths and weaknesses across different tasks, prompting recent studies to explore the benefits of model ensembling to leverage their complementary advantages. However, existing LLM ensembling methods often overlook model compatibility and struggle with inefficient probability alignment across the entire vocabulary.

In this work, we empirically investigate the factors influencing ensemble performance, identifying model performance, vocabulary size, and response style as key determinants. Our analysis reveals that compatibility among models is essential for effective ensembling, leading to the development of a straightforward yet effective model selection strategy to identify compatible models.

We introduce the UNIon Top-k Ensembling (UNITE), a novel approach that efficiently combines models by focusing on the union of the top-k tokens from each model. This method avoids the need for full vocabulary alignment, significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UNITE significantly enhances performance compared to existing methods, providing a more efficient framework for LLM ensembling.
